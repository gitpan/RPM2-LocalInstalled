RPM2-Local-Installed
================================

RPM2::LocalInstalled is a wrapper around RPM2. RPM2::LocalInstalled
will return a list of locally installed RPMs. But only the newest
RPMs will be listed. Eg. kernel-2.6.11 and kernel-2.6.10 are installed,
then only kernel-2.6.11 will be listed. This is usefully for comparing
with a list of updates, eg. from Config::YUM.

RPM2 cares about epochs, as rpm, since version 4 (I guess), does.
