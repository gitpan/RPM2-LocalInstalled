RPM2-Local-Installed
================================

RPM2::LocalInstalled is a wrapper around RPM2. RPM2::LocalInstalled
will return lists of locally installed RPMs.
This is usefully for comparing with a list of updates, eg. from
Config::YUM.

RPM2 cares about epochs, as rpm, since version 4 (I guess), does.
